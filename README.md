## Overview

This project transforms raw Formula 1 historical data into structured, analysis-ready datasets and uses them to answer seven concrete analytical questions about driver performance, team dominance, championship competitiveness, and engineering reliability across 25 seasons (2000–2024).

It is built as a **complete data engineering workflow** — not a single notebook — with modular source code, schema validation, structured logging, and four cleaned analytical marts as output. The analysis layer is a storytelling-driven Jupyter Notebook with hypothesis-driven sections and business-level conclusions.

## Business & Analytical Objective

Raw sports data is abundant. Analytical value is not. This project answers questions that go beyond *"who won the most races?"*:

| Question | Approach |
|---|---|
| Who are the greatest drivers of the modern era? | Career-level aggregated performance metrics |
| What separates elite drivers from very good ones? | Win rate vs podium rate multidimensional analysis |
| Was F1 competition as fierce as it felt? | Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) applied to win share |
| Which constructors dominated, and when did power shift? | Season-by-season time-series analysis |
| Does finishing races matter as much as going fast? | DNF rate vs points-per-race trade-off analysis |
| How close were the real title fights? | Margin-of-victory decomposition across 25 seasons |
| Which teams built the most reliable cars? | Cross-season reliability heatmap (2015–2024) |

## Dataset

**Source:** [Ergast Motor Racing API](http://ergast.com/mrd/) — flat-file historical export.

| Table | Rows | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `results` | 26,759 | Core race outcomes |
| `lap_times` | 589,081 | Per-lap performance |
| `driver_standings` | 34,863 | Cumulative WDC standings |
| `constructor_standings` | 13,391 | Cumulative WCC standings |
| `pit_stops` | 11,371 | Stop timing and duration |
| `qualifying` | 10,494 | Q1/Q2/Q3 lap times |
| `races` | 1,125 | Race metadata |
| `drivers` | 861 | Driver profiles |
| `constructors` | 212 | Team profiles |
| `circuits` | 77 | Track metadata |

**Key data quality challenges handled by the pipeline:** non-standard null encoding (`\N`), mixed-type position column (integers + status codes), lap time strings requiring millisecond parsing, calendar size drift (16 → 24 races/season).

## Key Insights

1. **Hamilton leads by volume; Verstappen leads by rate.** Hamilton's 4,820 career points and 105 wins are the modern era's greatest. But Verstappen averages 13.9 pts/race vs Hamilton's 13.5, with a near-identical win rate (~30%) achieved in half the career length.

2. **2023 was the most statistically dominant season in modern F1 history.** Verstappen's HHI of 0.76 (21/22 wins, 290-pt margin) exceeds Schumacher's most extreme year (2004, HHI = 0.54) by a wide margin. By economic standards, it was a monopoly.

3. **Real title fights are rare.** Only 8 of 25 seasons were decided by fewer than 20 points. Four were decided by 4 points or fewer (2007: 1pt, 2008: 1pt, 2010: 4pts, 2012: 3pts).

4. **Reliability and speed are not a trade-off — elite teams optimise both simultaneously.** Mercedes averaged 95%+ reliability throughout their 8-title hybrid era. Ferrari's reliability failures in competitive years are a quantifiable opportunity cost in championship points.

5. **The calendar grew 50% since 2003** (16 → 24 races). Raw career totals systematically favour modern-era drivers. Per-race normalisation is analytically mandatory for cross-era comparisons.

6. **2012 was the most competitive season in modern F1** (HHI = 0.165). Seven different winners in seven races; championship decided on the final lap of the final race by 3 points.

## Analysis Layer

The notebook (`notebooks/F1_Analysis.ipynb`) contains 41 cells structured as a complete analytical presentation:

- **Section 1:** Introduction and 7 analytical questions
- **Section 2:** Data overview — all four marts examined before any chart is drawn
- **Section 3:** Data preparation — theme, subsets, methodology notes
- **Section 4:** Seven analyses — each with hypothesis, chart, and data-driven insight
- **Section 5:** Conclusions — five strategic findings
- **Section 6:** Executive Summary — stakeholder briefing format

## How to Run

### 1. Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/f1-data-pipeline.git
cd f1-data-pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Add raw data
Place all 14 Ergast CSV files in `data/raw/`.

### 3. Run the pipeline
```bash
python src/pipeline.py
```
Produces four marts in `outputs/` and a timestamped log in `logs/`.

### 4. Open the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/F1_Analysis.ipynb
```
The notebook reads from `outputs/` — run the pipeline first.

### Configuration
Edit `CONFIG` in `src/pipeline.py` to change era scope, output format (`"csv"` or `"parquet"`), or toggle schema validation.

## Future Improvements

- **Qualifying delta analysis** — which drivers gained the most positions from grid to finish?
- **Teammate head-to-head** — the cleanest isolation of driver talent: same car, same season
- **Circuit-specific performance** — systematic over/underperformance at specific tracks
- **Pit stop strategy modelling** — separating strategic advantage from pace advantage
- **dbt integration** — replace `transformation.py` with dbt models for SQL-native transformations
- **Airflow orchestration** — schedule the pipeline as a DAG with dependency management
